## Project Outline/Needed Tasks
**Setup**
- Training Set : Take averages of predictors over years 2000-2014 for each country. (178 observations by 19 predictors)
  - Only have 19 predictors because we want to remove the developing vs. developed predictors (1 predictors in dataset)
- Testing Set: Data from 2015 (178 observations by 19 predictors)


### Questions
- **Prediction** : Given a set of health-related predictors, what is a country's average life expectancy?
  - Brett/Yen
  - PREDICTORS : do not include country, region, develop/developing
  - METHOD: best subset, exhaustive
  - Set up training and testing set (possibly remove the developed/developing)
  - F-test
  - Check for multicolineraity (VIF)
  - Model selection
  - Output our predictions
- **Classification** : Given a set of health related predictors, is a countries GDP per capita above or below the world average?
  - Abbie/Amanda
  - GOAL: what health predictors can countries focus on to improve or maintain economy/GDP
  - METHOD: try multiple, KNN? - not many normal distibutions in preidctors
  - Adult mortality, education, vaccination rates, population, alchohol consuption, life expectancy
  - Set up training and testing set.
  - Find world average GDP per capita to serve as our threshold (under = 0, over  = 1) --> 10,154 (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD)
  - Create a varible of 0/1 to indicate GDP per captia over or under average.
  - F-test
  - Check for multicolineraity (VIF)
  - Model selection
