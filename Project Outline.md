## Project Outline/Needed Tasks
**Setup**
- Training Set : Take averages of predictors over years 2000-2014 for each country. (178 observations by 19 predictors)
  - Only have 19 predictors because we want to remove the developing vs. developed predictors (2 predictors in dataset)
- Testing Set: Data from 2015 (178 observations by 19 predictors)


### Questions
- **Prediction** : Given a set of health-related predictors, what is a country's average life expectancy?
  - Set up training and testing set 
  - F-test
  - Model selection
  - Output our predictions
- **Classification** : Given a set of health related predictors, is a countries GDP per capita above or below the world average?
  - Set up training and testing set
  - Find world average GDP per capita to serve as our threshold (under = 0, over  = 1) --> 10,154 (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD)
